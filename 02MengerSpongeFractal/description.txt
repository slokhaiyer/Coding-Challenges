The MegaMenger may be the largest fractal ever built, made out of over a million business cards and encompassing the entire Earth. 
A Menger Sponge is a three-dimensional fractal, which can be made by taking a cube and cutting out a square section through the centre in each of the three directions; then each of the resulting smaller cubes is cut out in the same way, and so on until you've removed infinitely many pieces.
So each Menger Sponge is made from twenty identical-but-smaller Menger Sponges. 
This results in an object which has zero volume but infinite surface area!
